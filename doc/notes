Raster processing https://strimas.com/post/processing-large-rasters-in-r/
Experiments show that with each call to `grid.raster`, more memory is consumed and the display takes longer. Let's explore the raster package instead. https://rspatial.org/raster/RasterPackage.pdf. help("raster-package")

Raster package mentions using multiple cores via the snow package.



User input - key press

to detect keypress, tried using library tcltk. Library load failed with 
Error: package or namespace load failed for ‘tcltk’:
 .onLoad failed in loadNamespace() for 'tcltk', details:
  call: dyn.load(file, DLLpath = DLLpath, ...)
  error: unable to load shared object '/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.1/Resources/library/tcltk/libs/tcltk.so':
  dlopen(/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.1/Resources/library/tcltk/libs/tcltk.so, 10): Library not loaded: /opt/X11/lib/libfontconfig.1.dylib
  Referenced from: /usr/local/lib/libtk8.6.dylib
  Reason: Incompatible library version: libtk8.6.dylib requires version 11.0.0 or later, but libfontconfig.1.dylib provides version 10.0.0

Recommendation is to install XQuartz from https://www.xquartz.org/
Also need xcrun: `xcode-select --install` (after OSX upgrade)
Worked after installing these.

Documentation for tcltk is at https://www.tcl.tk/doc/. https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.7/ is most useful page.
